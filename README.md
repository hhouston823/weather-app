**Weather App**

A simple weather app that displays the current weather conditions for a given city.

**Features**

* Search for a city by name
* Displays current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon
* Supports multiple weather conditions (Clouds, Clear, Rain, Drizzle, Mist)

**Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository and open the file in a text editor or IDE.
2. Update the `apiKey` variable in the JavaScript code with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
3. Run the HTML file in a web browser to test the app.

**How it Works**

1. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather data for the specified city.
2. The data is then parsed and displayed on the page using JavaScript and CSS.
3. The app supports multiple weather conditions, and updates the icon and text accordingly.

**Known Issues**

* The app currently only supports English language text.
* The app does not handle errors well; if an invalid city name is entered, the app will display an error message but not provide any further information.
